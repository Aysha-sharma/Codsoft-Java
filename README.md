# 💼 Codsoft-Java Internship Projects

Welcome to my Java internship project portfolio! This repository showcases various Java-based projects I developed during my internship to enhance my programming, problem-solving, and object-oriented design skills.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Java SE 8+**
- **VS Code**
- **Git & GitHub**
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**

## 📂 Project List

### 1. 🎮 Number Guessing Game
A console-based number guessing game where:
- A random number is generated between 1 and 100.
- User guesses until correct or max attempts are reached.
- Supports multiple rounds and keeps track of score.

### 2. 📊 Student Grade Calculator
A console-based program that:
- Accepts the number of subjects and marks for each subject.
- Validates input marks (0–100).
- Calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades (A+, A, B, C, D, or F).
- Displays a detailed **report card**.

### 3. 🏧 ATM Interface
A console-based ATM simulation that:
- Provides **menu options** for balance inquiry, deposit, and withdrawal.
- Uses two classes: **BankAccount** (for storing and managing balance) and **ATM** (for user interface and operations).
- Validates user input (e.g., prevents withdrawal beyond the account balance).
- Displays appropriate success or failure messages for transactions.
- Designed using **OOP principles** with modular, reusable code.
